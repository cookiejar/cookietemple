Creating projects from templates is the heart of cookietemple.
Our templates adhere to best practices and try to be as modern as possible. Furthermore, they try to automate tasks such as automatically dependency resolvement and installation, packaging, deployment and more.
To learn more about our templates please visit :ref:`available_templates` and check out your template of interest.

Usage
-------

The creation of a new project can be invoked by

.. code-block:: console

    $ cookietemple create

which will guide you through the creation process of your (customized) project via prompts. If you do not have cookietemple configured yet, you will be asked to do so. For more details please visit :ref:`config`.


The prompts follow the pattern of domain (e.g. cli, gui, ...), subdomain (if applicable, e.g. website), language (e.g. Python) followed by template specific prompts (e.g. testing frameworks, ...).
The project will be created at the current working directory, where cookietemple has been called.


After the project has been created, linting (see :ref:`lint`) is automatically performed to verify that the template creation process was successful.


Finally, you will be asked whether you want to automatically push your new project to Github. Note that for this purpose you need to have cookietemple configured with a Github personal access token.
For more details about the Github support please visit :ref:`github_support`.

Flags

- ``--path`` [CWD]: An absolute or relative path to create the template at.

  All further prompts will still be asked for. Example: ``cli``.
