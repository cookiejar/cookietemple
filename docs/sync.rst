.. _sync:

=======================
Syncing your project
=======================

Syncing is supposed to integrate any changes to the COOKIETEMPLE templates back into your already existing project.
Due to the inherent complexity of this task, it is **not yet implemented**. However, discussions and contributions are very welcome! Please get in touch with us (see :ref:`contributing`).

Our first draft is available `here <https://github.com/cookiejar/cookietemple/issues/175>`_ for discussion.
