Shared FAQ
----------------------

How do I publish my documentation?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

cookietemple ships with a full, production ready `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ setup and with a complete gh-pages setup.

Read the Docs
+++++++++++++++++

You need to `import your documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html>`_ on Read the Docs website.
Do not forget to sync your account first to see your repository.
Your documentation will then be available on ``https://repositoryname.readthedocs.io/``

Github Pages
+++++++++++++++

Your documentation is automatically pushed to the ``gh-pages`` branch. Follow the documentation on
``configuring a publishing source for your Github pages site <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site>`_
and select the gh-pages branch. Your documentation will then be available on ``https://username.github.io/repositoryname``.

What is Dependabot and how do I set it up?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Dependabot <https://dependabot.com/>`_ is a service, which (for supported languages) automatically submits pull requests for dependency updates.
cookietemple templates ship with dependabot configurations, if the language is supported by Dependabot.
To enable Dependabot you need to login (with your Github account) and add your repository (or enable Dependabot for all repositories).
Note that you need to do this for every organization separately. Dependabot will then pick up the configuration and start submitting pull requests!

Release Drafter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Cookietemple 1.3.0, all templates received a new GitHub Action called Release drafter. This replaces the CHANGELOG.rst file of all templates.
Release drafter automatically includes references to all PRs made to the default branch and a description of what this PR was about (basically the PRs title) in a
release draft on GitHub. Per default, the release drafter of cookietemple's templates has been configured to distinguish between two main categories: Features and Fixes.
Every PR that was made from a branch called either feature/ (for Features) or fix/ (for Fixes) will automatically be grouped into those categories and be labelled
automatically. If no category was found, the changes will be grouped into a common Changes category.

How do I add a new template?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
