\dots and some more in the first subsub section otherwise it all looks the same
doesn't it? well we can add some text to it \dots

\section{The layout of formal tables}
This section has been modified from ``Publication quality tables in \LaTeX*''
 by Simon Fear.

The layout of a table has been established over centuries of experience and
should only be altered in extraordinary circumstances.

When formatting a table, remember two simple guidelines at all times:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Never, ever use vertical rules (lines).
  \item Never use double rules.
\end{enumerate}

These guidelines may seem extreme but I have
never found a good argument in favour of breaking them. For
example, if you feel that the information in the left half of
a table is so different from that on the right that it needs
to be separated by a vertical line, then you should use two
tables instead. Not everyone follows the second guideline:

There are three further guidelines worth mentioning here as they
are generally not known outside the circle of professional
typesetters and subeditors:

\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Put the units in the column heading (not in the body of
          the table).
  \item Always precede a decimal point by a digit; thus 0.1
      {\em not} just .1.
  \item Do not use `ditto' signs or any other such convention to
      repeat a previous value. In many circumstances a blank
      will serve just as well. If it won't, then repeat the value.
\end{enumerate}

A frequently seen mistake is to use `\textbackslash begin\{center\}' \dots `\textbackslash end\{center\}' inside a figure or table environment. This center environment can cause additional vertical space. If you want to avoid that just use `\textbackslash centering'
