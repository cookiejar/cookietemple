            Hi @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }},

            It looks like this pull-request is has been made against the ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}} `master` branch.
            A version check determined that you are using a SNAPSHOT version.
            The `master` branch should never have any SNAPSHOT versions, since only fully stable code should be on the `master` branch.
